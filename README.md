## SymbolTable

Implemented a SymbolTable based on a **HashTable** which can be used for both the IDENTIFIERS and CONSTANTS,
in the same table.
The methods of the **HashTable** are also implemented int the **SymbolTable**, except the `hash(String key)` method.
For tokens, the position in the SymbolTable is considered to be `(-1, -1)`.

### Pair
Implemented the pair class which has the integer `firstItem` and `secondItem` attributes, used for storing the position of an element from the SymbolTable (HashTable).

## HashTable
It is implemented as a list of lists, meaning that on each position from a list there is another list.

It has the following methods:
* `getSize()` - returns the size of the list which has as elements other lists
*  `hash(String key)` - returns the hash value of a given element as parameter
* `findElemPosition(String elem)` - returns the position of the element as a `Pair` object if found; otherwise, it
  returns null
* `containsElem(String elem)` - returns `true` whether the given element is found; otherwise, it returns `false`
* `findByPosition(Pair position)` - returns the element found on the given position. If the position is invalid, it
  throws `IndexOutOfBoundsException`
* `addElem(String elem)` - adds a new element into the table. It returns a pair with the position where it is located
  into the table. If the element already exists in the table, it throws an `Exception`
* `toString()` - override method that returns the size of the hash table and the elements

## ProgramInternalForm
It is implemented as a list of pairs where the first elements is the `element` and the second one is its `position`.

* `add(Pair<String, Pair<Integer, Integer>> tokenPair)` - adds the passed as parameter to the list
* `toString()` - prints all the elements of the PIF as: `element --> (listIndex, elemIndexInList)`

## MyScanner
It builds the **Program Internal Form (PIF)** and the **Symbol Table**, and it checks the given **source code** for
**lexical errors**. It also gets the **reserved words** and the **tokens** from a given file.

* `readTokens()` - reads the tokens file and adds the *reserved works* into `reservedWords` field and the *separators & operators*
  into `tokens`. Returns `IOException` if the tokens file was not found.
* `setSourceCode(String sourceCode)` - sets the `sourceCode` with the value passed as param.
* `start(String fileName)` - starts the sourceCode scanning and checks for lexical errors. The scanning action includes
  reading the source code, going through the source code and identifying the identifiers, string constants, integer constants
  and tokens. Also, all the identified elements are then memorized into the SymbolTable and all their positions into the PIF.
  If no errors were found, the contents of the **SymbolTable** and **PIF** are written into files, and it informs the user
  that the source code is lexically correct. Otherwise, it informs the user that there are lexical errors, and it
  specifies the line where the error occurred.
* `skipSpaces()` - skips spaces and increased the line number when the new line char is found.
* `tokenizer()` - it tokenizes the source code by searching for identifiers, constant integers, constant string and tokens.
  If none of the searched elements where not found, it throws `MyScannerException` and tells the user where the lexical
  error occurred.
* `tryIdentifierMatching()` - tries to match the current substring indicated by the index with an identifier. The matching
  flow is made of checking if the beginning of the substring matches format of an identifier by using regular expressions.
  If there is a match and the identifier is valid, the identifier is added to the SymbolTable (if it is not already contained
  in the SymbolTable) or it gets its position from the SymbolTable in order to be added to the PIF. It returns `false`,
  if there is no match or if the identifier is not valid. Otherwise, `true`.
* `validateIdentifier(String possibleIdentifier, String sourceCodeSubstr)` - validates the possible identifier by checking
  if it is a reserved word, it matches the identifier pattern, or if it already is found in the SymbolTable.
* `tryTokenListMatching()` - tries to match with a token from tokens list. First it checks whether it is a reserved word,
  then if it is a separator or an operator. Returns `true`, if it is a reserved word or a token from the list. Otherwise, `false`.
* `tryIntConstMatching()` - tries to match with a constant integer. Checks if the current element is a valid number,
  meaning it only contains digits (no other characters), starts with a digit greater than 0, and it might have the +/-
  specified in the beginning. Or it is simply 0. If it is a valid number, it is added to the SymbolTable (if it's not already)
  and added its position to the PIF. Returns `true`, if the number is valid. Otherwise, `false`.
* `tryStringConstMatching()` - tries to match with a constant string. Checks whether the current element is a valid string,
  meaning that the quotes are closed correctly and has no invalid chars. Returns `true`, if the string is valid. Otherwise, `false`.
* `getSymbolTable()` - returns the `symbolTable`.
* `getPIF()` - returns the `PIF`.


## MyScannerException
It is an exception class used for `MyScanner`, extending the `RuntimeException` class and overriding the `message` method.

## FiniteAutomaton

It is a **finite automation** that implements operations on an automaton read from a file.
The file consists of:
* states
* initial state
* final states
* alphabet
* transitions

The **FiniteAutomaton** has the following methods:
* `init()` - reads the automaton from the files and identifies the states, alphabet, final states and transitions.
  Throws and exception if the content of the file does not respect the structure.
* `printList(String listName, List<String> list)` - prints a list of string elements.
* `checkIfDeterministic()` - checks whether the automaton is deterministic or not. Returns true, if it is deterministic.
  Otherwise, false.
* `printDeterministicStatus()` - prints the status of the automaton being deterministic or not.
* `printAlphabet()` - prints the alphabet.
* `printStates()` - prints the states.
* `printFinalStates()` - prints the final states.
* `printInitialState()` - prints the initial state.
* `printTransitions()` - prints the transactions.
* `checkAccepted(String word)` - it checks whether a word is accepted or not. A word is accepted when for each character
  it contains, there is chain of transitions whose labels are equal with the characters of the word (respecting the same order)
  and the last state is among the final states. Returns true, if the word is accepted. Otherwise, false.
* `getNextAccepted(String word)` - identifies an accepted substring of the given word. Returns the substring which is accepted.
  If there is no accepted substring, it returns null.\

## Transition
It is a class that identifies a transition, having as members the **from state**, the **to state** and the **label** of it.
The transition has the `(from, to, label)` triplet form.

## FA.in file structure (EBNF)

`firstLine = "states" "=" "{" {character} {"," character} "}"`

`secondLine = "initial_state" "=" {character}`

`thirdLine = "final_states" "=" "{" {character} {"," character} "}"`

`forthLine = "alphabet" "=" "{" {character} {"," character} "}"`

`fifthLine = "transitions" "=" "{" triplet { ";" triplet} "}"`

`triplet = "(" {character} "," {character} "," {character} ")"`

`character = letter | digit`

`letter = a|b|..|z|A|B|..|Z`

`non_zero_digit = 1|2|..|9`

`digit = 0|1|...|9`

`number = non_zero_digit {digit}`

## Parser
* `checkGrammarLeftRecursive` - checks if the grammars is left recursive. Returns true if is left recursive. Otherwise, false
* `momentaryInsuccess` - changes the state to `BACK`
* `success` - changes the state to `FINAL`
* `advance` - increases the index with 1. Pushes the top element of the inputStack into the workingStack. Pops the element from the inputStack.
* `exapnd` - Takes the non-terminal from the inputStack and searches for the first production. Pushes on the workingStack
  the first production of the non-terminal as a list containing the non-terminal and the first production. Pops the non-terminal from the inputStack and pushes the first production into the inputStack.
* `back` - decreases the index with 1. Moves the terminal from the working stack to the input stack
* `anotherTry` - takes another try by going to the next production if available. Error if it reaches the index 1 and the non-terminal equals the starting symbol. Otherwise, exception.
* `readSequence` - reads a string from a text file and returns a String array of chars
* `checkSequence` - checks whether the given sequence accepted

## ParserOutput

* `parsingProductionString()` - returns a list of the rules. Adds the productions needed for building the tree
*  `parsingTable()` - creates the root of the tree and calls the function for building the tree starting from the root
* `parsingTableRec(Node father, List<List<String>> rules, int ruleIndex)` - recursive function that builds the nodes starting from the root. It uses the rules provided as a parameter and keeps track of the index of the children
* `printParsingTable()` - prints the parsing table (index, name, parent, right sibling of every node in the tree)
* `printParsingTableToFile()` - prints the parsing table to a text file
